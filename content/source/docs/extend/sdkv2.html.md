# Terraform Plugin SDKv2

Terraform Plugin SDKv2 is the main SDK for provider development today, and what
we recommend most users use.

You can find more information about Terraform Plugin SDKv2 on
[GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk) or using the links
in the menu, which document various parts of the SDK.
